        Summary</h2>\n\n<p>\nA M5.7 aftershock to the M7.2 April, 4th 2010 Easter
        Sunday mainshock, called El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, occurred at 9:27 pm
        (Western Standard Time) on June 14th, about 5 miles southeast of the Imperial
        County community of Ocotillo, at the US Mexico border. This aftershock was
        the largest so far of the M7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah sequence. This aftershock
        was located within the large cluster of aftershocks at the northwest end of
        the ongoing aftershock sequence. The M5.7 event was followed by its own vigorous
        aftershock sequence, with four M4+ and 35 M3 to M4 events, during the first
        12 hours.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe M5.7 June 14th event probably occurred on a northwest
        striking fault that follows the trend of the Elsinore fault in this region.
        The Elsinore fault is more than 110 miles long, and extends into the Orange
        County and Los Angeles area as the Whittier fault. The Elsinore fault is capable
        of a major earthquake that would significantly affect the large metropolitan
        areas of southern California. The Elsinore fault has not hosted a major earthquake
        in more than 100 years.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe occurrence of this aftershock and
        its own aftershock sequence, and the M4.9 earthquake that occurred along the
        San Jacinto fault on June 12th 2010 demonstrate that the earthquake activity
        in the region remains at an elevated level. The San Jacinto fault is known
        as the most active earthquake fault in southern California. Caltech and USGS
        seismologist continue to monitor the on going earthquake activity using the
        Caltech/USGS Southern California Seismic Network and a GPS network of more
        than 100 stations.\n</p>\n"}}}],"impact-text":[{"indexid":"42258191","indexTime":1417563427981,"id":"urn:usgs-product:us:impact-text:usp000he04:1415324501091","type":"impact-text","code":"usp000he04","source":"us","updateTime":1415324501091,"status":"UPDATE","properties":{"eventParametersPublicID":"quakeml:US.anss.org/eventParameters/pde20100615042658480_5/1415324501091","eventsource":"us","eventsourcecode":"p000he04"},"preferredWeight":6,"contents":{"":{"contentType":"text/plain","lastModified":1415324501000,"length":654,"bytes":"Some
